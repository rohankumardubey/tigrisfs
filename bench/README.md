## Simple tests

Test cases:
- Create 6400 files, sized 0.5-300KB, 30KB on average, sharded over 1024 dirs
  with 2 level deep nesting. Similar to copying static files of a small site into S3.
  You can use `gen_small.py` to run this test.
- Delete these 6400 files from S3 (`rm -rf dir`).
- Write 1 10GB file to S3.
- Read 1 10GB file from S3.

| Case       | tigrisfs  | rclone+cache | rclone     | goofys   | s3fs     |
| ---------- | --------:| ------------:| ----------:| --------:| --------:|
| cp -r 6400 | **0:25** | 6:20         | 7:03       | 8:51     | 53:30    |
| rm -r 6400 | **0:22** | 6:16         | 6:20       | 8:36     | 18:26    |
| read 10G   | 330 MB/s | 56 MB/s      | 63 MB/s    | 530 MB/s | 140 MB/s |
| write 10G  | 420 MB/s | FAIL (HANG)  | FAIL (OOM) | 560 MB/s | 100 MB/s |

All tests were run in a Yandex Cloud VM Instance connecting to Yandex Object Storage.

Don't treat these numbers as a public commitment though :) your mileage may vary
depending on current load of the VM, network and so on.

## mdtest

mdtest is a simple FS metadata operations test: https://github.com/hpc/ior

Note that because of the asynchronous nature of TigrisFS, modified mdtest was used for testing:
https://github.com/vitalif/mdtest - this version issues a directory fsync after each test to
flush all changes to S3.

Results with the same parameters as in JuiceFS tests:
https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/docs/en/mdtest.md

`./mdtest -d ~/ya/mdtest -b 6 -I 8 -z 4`

JuiceFS here was using Redis for metadata storage.

The results show that TigrisFS with **just S3** may be faster than JuiceFS with **in-memory**
metadata storage. The only exception is directory rename, for obvious reasons - S3 doesn't have renames.

## Goofys tests

These tests are run with `./run_bench.sh` in this directory. They're rather simple
but the results are also included for completeness:
